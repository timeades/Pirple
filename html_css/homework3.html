                <p> The <span>origin of lemon cake is unknown.</span> It is probably derived from the <span>pound cake,</span> which was first baked in <span>England around 1700.</span><br>
                A pound of each ingredient was used to make a simple, heavy cake to feed large groups of people.</p>

            <ul class="icon-bullets">
                <li>225g unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>225g caster sugar</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
                <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
                <strong>For the drizzle topping</strong>
                <li>1½ lemons, juiced</li>
                <li>85g caster sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-headings">Method</h3>
            <ol class="roman-bullets">
                <li>Heat the oven to <span>180C/160C fan/gas 4</span></li>
                <li>Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, <span>one at a time, slowly mixing through.</span> 🥣  </li>
                 <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
                 <li>Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Bake for <span>45-50 minutes</span> until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. ⏲️ </li>
                <li><span>While the cake is cooling in its tin</span>, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle. 🍋 </li>
                 <li>Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle –
                     the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.<br>
                     <span>Leave in the tin until completely cool,</span> then remove and serve. 🥄 🤤 <br>
                     It will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or <span>freeze for up to 1 month.</span> 😀</li>
