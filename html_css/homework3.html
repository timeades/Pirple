<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>225g unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>225g caster sugar</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
    <strong>For the drizzle topping</strong>
    <li>1½ lemons, juiced</li>
    <li>85g caster sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method 🧑‍🍳</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4</li>
    <li>Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through. 🥣  </li>
    <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
    <li>Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
    <li>Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. ⏲️ </li>
    <li>While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle. 🍋 </li>
    <li>Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle –
        the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.
        Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. 🥄 🤤 <br>
       It will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month. 😀</li>
</ol>
