Part 1: Write the HTML

We didn't cover all the possible HTML tags yet. What are they? And what should they be used for?

For this project you should:

1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). This can take any form. You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

For extra credit, use one or more of these tags (if you haven't already):

1. <video>
2. <audio>
3. <form>
4. <select>
5. <input>
6. <base>
7. <meta>
8. <iframe>
