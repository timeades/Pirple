Homework Assignment #5: Classes and IDs


Part 1: Write the Code

1. Refactor (aka rewrite / reorganize) your code from assignment #4 so that more than 75% of your CSS is selecting elements by classes and IDs.
2. Give your ordered list and unordered list unique classes.
3. If you haven't yet, find a resource online that explains all the different CSS properties you can use in your website.
4. Change the bullet-points in the unordered list so that they are an image/icon of your choosing.
5. Change the numbers in the ordered list so that they are roman numerals instead.
6. Within one of your paragraphs, add <span> elements around several words or phrases that should be emphasized.
7. Within your CSS create a selector that will only apply to <span> elements that are within <p> elements, and make them italic.
8. Within your CSS create a selector that will only apply the last <span> within a <p> tag, and make it underlined.
9. Give the first <span> element within the <p> tag a special class. Now add CSS that will remove the italics and apply a red color instead.
