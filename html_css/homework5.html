        <div>
            <p>Lemon Drizzle Cake with its beautiful, <span id="highlight-red">light sponge and fresh, zesty flavours</span> is a timeless bake that we can't seem to tire of.<br>
                This <span>small-batch</span> version means that you can enjoy it even more often!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p> The <span>origin of lemon cake is unknown.</span> It is probably derived from the <span>pound cake,</span> which was first baked in <span id="highlight-underline">England around 1700.</span><br>
                A pound of each ingredient was used to make a simple, heavy cake to feed large groups of people.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-headings">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="icon-bullets">
            <li>225g unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>225g caster sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <strong>For the drizzle topping</strong>
            <li>1½ lemons, juiced</li>
            <li>85g caster sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-headings">Method</h3>
        <ol class="roman-bullets">
            <li>Heat the oven to <em>180C/160C fan/gas 4</em></li>
            <li>Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, <em>one at a time, slowly mixing through.</em> 🥣  </li>
            <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Bake for <em>45-50 minutes</em> until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. ⏲️ </li>
            <li><em>While the cake is cooling in its tin</em>, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle. 🍋 </li>
            <li>Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle –
                the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.<br>
                <em>Leave in the tin until completely cool,</em> then remove and serve. 🥄 🤤 <br>
                It will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or <em>freeze for up to 1 month.</em> 😀</li>
